c     Finite Element Analysis Program -- personal version -- (FEAPpv) for
c     solution of general problem classes using the finite element method.
c     Problem size is controlled by dimension of blank common  & value of
c     variable 'maxm' as set in the parameter statement below.

c     Programmed by:
c                R. L. Taylor
c                Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering
c                University of California at Berkeley

c     Notes:

c     1. Precision is controlled by ipr:

c        Set ipr = 1 for 8-byte integers; = 2 for 4-byte integers.

c     2. User written subprograms should include type specification
c        for all variables in each subprogram.

c        e.g.    implicit  none
c                real*8    a(12)
c                integer   name
c                character word*6
c                logical   flag
c                etc.

c     3. FEAPpv may create temporary input files during use.
c        Users should periodically check and delete files
c        which are no longer needed.  File names are normally
c        either the name of the data input file with an extender
c        or the name of the plot save file with an extender.

c     4. Input/Output is performed to files during execution of FEAPpv.
c        In general, the following files are used during executions:

c           a.  iop = 11 : Used for read/write delayed inputs.
c           b.  ios = 12 : Used for read/write scratch files.
c           c.  ird = 13 : Used to read results data from disk.
c           d.  iwd = 14 : Used to write results data to disk.
c           e.  ior = 15 : Use to read from the input data file.
c                          (specified when a problem is initiated).
c           f.  iow = 16 : Use to write output result data to file.
c                          (specified when a problem is initiated).
c           g.  lun = 17 : For PostScript file outputs.
c           h.  icl = 18+: Used for include file inputs.
c                          (additional include files may be opened).
